                    Java is a programming language that produces software for multiple platforms. When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems (OS), including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Java derives much of its syntax from the C and C++ programming languages.<br>
                    It is used for:
                    <li>Mobile applications (specially Android apps)</li>
                    <li>Desktop applications</li>
                    <li>Web applications</li>
                    <li>Web servers and application servers</li>
                    <li>Games</li>
                    <li>Database connection</li>
                    <li>And much, much more!</li>

			<h1 style="font-family: ONEDAY;">Features of Java</h1>
			<h4 style="font-family: CodeDemo-Bold;">List is On</h4>

			<ul style="font-family: Raleway-Thin;font-weight: bold;font-size: 20px;">
			<p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">1) Compiled and Interpreter: </p>
			Java is easy to learn and its syntax is quite simple, clean and easy to understand.The confusing and ambiguous concepts of C++ are either left out in Java or they have been re-implemented in a cleaner way.<br>
			Eg : Pointers and Operator Overloading are not there in java but were an important part of C++.

			<p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">2) Platform Independent</p>

			Unlike other programming languages such as C, C++ etc which are compiled into platform specific machines. Java is guaranteed to be write-once, run-anywhere language.

			On compilation Java program is compiled into bytecode. This bytecode is platform independent and can be run on any machine, plus this bytecode format also provide security. Any machine with Java Runtime Environment can run Java Programs.<br>
			<img src="images/java-platform-independent.png" alt="..." class="rounded" height="60%" width="100%">
			<p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">3) Object-Oriented:</p>

			In java everything is Object which has some data and behaviour. Java can be easily extended as it is based on Object Model<br><div class="col-md-4"></div>

			<p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">4) Robust and Secure:</p>

			Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone codes by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking. But the main areas which Java improved were Memory Management and mishandled Exceptions by introducing automatic Garbage Collector and Exception Handling.<br>
			 
			Secure:<br> When We convert the Code from One Machine to Another the First Check the Code either it is Effected by the Virus or not or it Checks the Safety of the Code if code contains the Virus then it will never Executed that code on to the Machine.<br>
		
		
			<p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">5) Distributed:</p>

			Java is Distributed Language Means because the program of java is compiled onto one machine can be easily transferred to machine and Executes them on another machine because facility of Bytes Codes So java is Specially designed For Internet Users which uses the Remote Computers For Executing their Programs on local machine after transferring the Programs from Remote Computers or either from the internet.  <br>
			<p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">6) Simple Small and Familiar:</p>

            A simple Language Because it contains many features of other Languages like c and C++ and Java Removes Complexity because it doesn’t use pointers, Storage classes and Go to Statements and java Doesn’t support Multiple Inheritance<br>

            <p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">7) Multithreaded and Interactive:</p>

            Java uses Multithreaded Techniques For Execution Means Like in other in Structure Languages Code is Divided into the Small Parts Like These Code of java is divided into the Smaller parts those are Executed by java in Sequence and Timing Manner this is Called as Multithreaded In this Program of java is divided into the Small parts those are Executed by Compiler of java itself Java is Called as Interactive because Code of java Supports Also CUI and Also GUI Programs <br>
  
            <p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">8) High performance:</p>

           Java programs are complied to portable intermediate form know as bytecodes, rather than to native machine level instructions and JVM executes Java bytecode on. Any machine on which it is installed. This architecture means that Java programs are faster than program or scripts written in purely interpreted languages but slower than C and C++ programs that compiled to native machine languages.

			Although in the early releases of Java, the interpretation of by bytecode resulted in slow performance but the advance version of JVM uses the adaptive and Just in time (JIT) compilation technique that improves performance by converting Java bytecodes to native machine instructions on the fly.<br>

           <p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">9)Dynamic and Extensible </p>

          Java has Dynamic and Extensible Code Means With the Help of OOPS java Provides Inheritance and With the Help of Inheritance we Reuse the Code that is Pre-defined and Also uses all the built in Functions of java and Classes<br>
