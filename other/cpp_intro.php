                     C++, as we all know is an extension to C language and was developed by Bjarne stroustrup at bell labs. C++ is an intermediate level language, as it comprises a confirmation of both high level and low level language features. C++ is a statically typed, free form, multiparadigm, compiled general-purpose language.<br>

					C++ is an Object Oriented Programming language but is not purely Object Oriented. Its features like Friend and Virtual, violate some of the very important OOPS features, rendering this language unworthy of being called completely Object Oriented. Its a middle level language.<br>

			<h1 style="font-family: ONEDAY;">Features of C++</h1>
			<h4 style="font-family: CodeDemo-Bold;">List is On</h4>
			<ul style="font-family: Raleway-Thin;font-weight: bold;font-size: 20px;">
			<p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">1) Simple </p>
			C++ is a simple language in the sense that it provides structured approach (to break the problem into parts), rich set of library functions, data types etc.<br>
			Eg : Pointers and Operator Overloading are not there in java but were an important part of C++.<br>
			<p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">2) Machine Independent or Portable</p>

			Unlike assembly language, c programs can be executed in many machines with little bit or no change. But it is not platform-independent.

			<br>
			
			<p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">3) Mid-level programming language</p>

			C++ is also used to do low level programming. It is used to develop system applications such as kernel, driver etc. It also supports the feature of high level language. That is why it is known as mid-level language.<br>

			<p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">4) Structured programming language</p>

			C++ is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify.<br>
			
			<p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">5) Rich Library</p>

			C++ provides a lot of inbuilt functions that makes the development fast.  <br>
			<p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">6) Memory Management</p>

            It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C++ language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.<br>

            <p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">7) Speed</p>

            The compilation and execution time of C++ language is fast.<br>
  
            <p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">8) Pointer</p>

           C++ provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers. We can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array etc.<br>

           <p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">9) Recursion </p>

         In C++, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function.<br>
          <p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">10) Extensible </p>

       C++ language is extensible because it can easily adopt new features.<br>
          <p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">11) Object Oriented</p>

         C++ is object oriented programming language. OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grows.<br>
          <p style="box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.12),0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.40);color: gray;">12) Compiler based </p>

         C++ is a compiler based programming language, it means without compilation no C++ program can be executed. First we need to compile our program using compiler and then we can execute our program.<br>
